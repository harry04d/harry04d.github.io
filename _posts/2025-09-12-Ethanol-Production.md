# Abstract  
The **Rice-Based Ethanol Production Project** investigated the feasibility of producing ethanol from rice through fermentation and subsequent distillation. By converting rice starches into fermentable sugars, yeast-driven fermentation produced ethanol, which was then separated and concentrated using distillation techniques. This project provided insights into biofuel production, fermentation processes, and the practical aspects of small-scale ethanol recovery.  

# Project Objectives  
From the outset, I set out to:  
- Explore rice as a carbohydrate-rich feedstock for ethanol production.  
- Learn enzymatic and microbial pathways for converting starches to sugars.  
- Conduct fermentation using yeast to produce ethanol.  
- Apply distillation to separate and purify ethanol from the fermentation broth.  
- Evaluate efficiency, yield, and purity compared to theoretical values.  

# Process Design Considerations  

**Raw Material Preparation**  
Rice was cooked and gelatinized to break down starch granules, making them more accessible for enzymatic hydrolysis.  

**Saccharification**  
Enzymes (such as amylase) or natural breakdown methods were used to convert rice starch into fermentable sugars like glucose.  

**Fermentation**  
Prepared rice mash was inoculated with yeast under anaerobic conditions. Fermentation was monitored over several days, with CO₂ release and alcohol content measured as indicators of progress.  

**Distillation**  
After fermentation, the ethanol-containing liquid was distilled to concentrate ethanol by exploiting the boiling point difference between ethanol and water. Multiple distillation cycles improved purity.  

# Key Lessons  

- **Feedstock Potential** – Rice provided a readily available carbohydrate source for ethanol, though efficiency depended on enzyme activity and preparation.  
- **Fermentation Control** – Temperature, pH, and yeast health were critical for maximizing ethanol yield.  
- **Distillation Practice** – I gained experience in fractional distillation, understanding azeotropes and ethanol-water separation limits.  
- **Biofuel Insights** – While small-scale yields were modest, the project highlighted how agricultural byproducts could be repurposed into sustainable fuels.

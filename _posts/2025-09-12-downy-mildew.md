# Abstract  
The **Hydroponic Grapevine Resistance Project** explored the use of hydroponic systems to cultivate grapevine species under controlled conditions, with the goal of inducing resistance to downy mildew (*Plasmopara viticola*). By modifying growth conditions and inoculating plants in a controlled manner, the project aimed to strengthen natural immunity pathways within the vines. This approach combined plant pathology, hydroponic cultivation, and biological resistance strategies, contributing to sustainable viticulture practices.  

# Project Objectives  
From the outset, I set out to:  
- Develop a hydroponic system suitable for grapevine growth and monitoring.  
- Inoculate grapevines with controlled exposure to downy mildew to stimulate resistance mechanisms.  
- Assess physiological and morphological changes in treated plants.  
- Explore long-term potential for developing mildew-resistant grapevine varieties.  

# Design Considerations  

**Hydroponic Cultivation**  
Hydroponics provided precise control over nutrients, pH, and environmental factors. This system minimized soilborne pathogens while enabling close monitoring of plant responses.  

**Inoculation and Immunity Development**  
Grapevines were gradually exposed to downy mildew spores under controlled conditions. The strategy aimed to stimulate systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and enhance natural plant defenses without causing lethal infection.  

**Observation and Data Collection**  
Growth rates, leaf morphology, chlorosis levels, and signs of infection were closely monitored. Comparisons were made between inoculated plants and non-inoculated controls.  

# Key Lessons  

- **Hydroponic Precision** – Using a soil-free system allowed for greater consistency in plant health and pathogen exposure.  
- **Plant Immune Response** – Grapevines demonstrated measurable resistance traits when gradually exposed to downy mildew.  
- **Sustainability Potential** – Enhancing natural resistance could reduce reliance on fungicides, offering more sustainable viticulture practices.  
- **Experimental Challenges** – Balancing exposure levels to trigger immunity without overwhelming the plant required careful calibration.

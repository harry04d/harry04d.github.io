# Abstract 
The **Fungal Inoculation of Native Grass for Biobrick Development** project explored the potential of combining mycelium growth with native Australian grasses to produce bio-based construction materials. By cultivating fungi at home and inoculating dried grass substrates, the project aimed to grow solid, lightweight, and biodegradable bricks. This approach leveraged the natural binding properties of fungal mycelium to strengthen plant matter, offering a sustainable alternative to cement and fired-clay bricks.  

# Project Objectives
This project set out to:
- Learn techniques for cultivating fungi at home for controlled mycelial growth.  
- Inoculate native Australian grasses with fungi to create a composite biobrick material.  
- Explore curing and growth conditions that maximize binding strength and minimize brittleness.  
- Investigate the structural, thermal, and biodegradability properties of the resulting biobricks.  
- Gain practical experience in applied mycology, biomaterials, and sustainable building design.  

# Design Considerations
Substrate Selection  
Native Australian grasses were chosen for their fibrous structure and compatibility with fungal colonization. They served both as a nutrient source and as a structural framework for the mycelium.  

Fungal Cultivation  
Fungi were grown under sterile conditions and transferred to sterilized grass substrates to ensure consistent inoculation. Growth chambers (with controlled humidity and darkness) were used to optimize colonization.  

Brick Formation  
Once the mycelium colonized the grass substrate, the material was placed into molds to shape bricks. Growth was allowed to continue until the substrate was fully bound, after which the biobricks were dried and cured to halt further fungal growth.  

Performance Testing  
Biobricks were assessed for compressive strength, weight, and moisture resistance. Comparisons were made against conventional clay bricks and earlier seaweed–grass composites.  

# Key Lessons 
- **Mycelium as a Binder** – Fungal growth proved highly effective at binding grass fibres into a solid composite material.  
- **Environmental Sensitivity** – Growth conditions (temperature, humidity, contamination) were critical in determining success and consistency.  
- **Material Potential** – The resulting biobricks were lightweight and biodegradable, with potential for use in low-load or temporary construction applications.  
- **Scaling Challenges** – Achieving uniform growth and mechanical strength across larger samples highlighted the need for controlled environments and repeatable processes.

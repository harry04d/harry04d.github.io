# Abstract  
The **Winogradsky Column Project** was designed to cultivate and analyze anaerobic bacterial communities for potential applications in **antibiotic discovery**. Environmental samples were collected from **Jindabyne Lake** and the **Snowy River** before being used to construct Winogradsky columns that simulate natural sedimentary environments. Over time, stratified microbial layers developed, creating conditions suitable for studying anaerobic bacteria. These columns were later sent to the **CSIRO laboratory** for further microbial and biochemical analysis.

# Project Objectives  
- Develop **Winogradsky columns** to culture diverse microbial communities under anaerobic conditions.  
- Use natural sediment and water from **Jindabyne Lake** and the **Snowy River** as microbial sources.  
- Observe microbial growth and stratification to identify potential anaerobic bacteria.  
- Provide enriched samples to **CSIRO laboratories** for antibiotic screening.

# Design Overview  
**Column Construction**  
- Plastic containers filled with **sediment, lake water, and organic material** (cellulose, calcium carbonate, and sulfur sources).  
- Designed to promote microbial succession and anaerobic stratification.  

**Incubation Process**  
- Columns were exposed to light over several weeks to encourage microbial growth.  
- Distinct layers formed, each containing different bacterial communities adapted to varying oxygen and nutrient levels.  

**Sample Analysis**  
- Once microbial communities were established, samples were prepared and transported to the **CSIRO laboratory**.  
- Target organisms included **anaerobic bacteria** with the potential to produce novel antibiotic compounds.

# Key Lessons Learned  
- **Environmental Microbiology**: Learned how to replicate natural microbial ecosystems in controlled conditions.  
- **Anaerobic Cultivation**: Gained experience in cultivating bacteria adapted to low-oxygen environments.  
- **Research Collaboration**: Understood the importance of partnering with institutions like **CSIRO** for advanced biochemical and genetic analysis.  
- **Applied Science**: Realized how environmental sampling can lead to the discovery of new bioactive compounds with **medical applications**.

# Future Improvements  
- Incorporate **metagenomic sequencing** of Winogradsky samples before transfer to labs for more detailed microbial profiling.  
- Experiment with different organic substrates to enrich for specific microbial groups.  
- Scale up the column design for greater biomass production, facilitating antibiotic compound extraction.

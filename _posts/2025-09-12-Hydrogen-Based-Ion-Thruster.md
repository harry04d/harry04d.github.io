# Abstract  
The **Hydrogen-Based Ion Thruster** was developed as an experimental propulsion device to investigate the feasibility of accelerating hydrogen ions through an electrostatic mechanism. By using two high-voltage wires to create an electric field, hydrogen gas was ionized and propelled along the field lines. Hydrogen was selected as the working fluid due to its low cost and availability from a previously built hydrogen generator. This project provided practical insights into plasma physics, electrostatic propulsion, and the challenges of developing ion-based thrust systems.  

# Project Objectives  
From the outset, I set out to:  
- Design and construct a simple ion propulsion device using hydrogen as the propellant.  
- Test whether a two-wire high-voltage system could ionize and accelerate hydrogen particles.  
- Gain experience in handling high-voltage systems safely in a controlled laboratory setup.  
- Assess the potential thrust generation and efficiency of a hydrogen-based ion thruster.  

# Design Considerations  

**Propellant Selection**  
Hydrogen was chosen as the ionized medium due to its abundance, low molecular mass, and accessibility from my previously constructed hydrogen generator. These properties make hydrogen particularly attractive for ion propulsion experiments.  

**Electrostatic Acceleration Mechanism**  
The thruster utilized two wires positioned in parallel with a high voltage applied between them. The strong electric field ionized incoming hydrogen gas and accelerated the resulting charged particles along the wire axis, creating directed particle flow.  

**System Construction and Safety**  
Key design elements included insulation of high-voltage components, secure mounting of the wire system, and careful control of hydrogen gas input to avoid hazards. Voltage levels had to be carefully regulated to achieve ionization without causing breakdown or arcing.  

# Key Lessons  

- **Hydrogen as Propellant** – Its low cost and availability make hydrogen ideal for experimental ion propulsion, though storage and handling safety are critical.  
- **Ionization Challenges** – Achieving stable ionization required balancing gas flow rate and voltage strength to prevent unwanted discharge effects.  
- **Thrust Limitations** – While visible ion flow was achieved, measurable thrust was extremely low due to system inefficiencies.  
- **High-Voltage Safety** – Working with kilovolt-level fields reinforced the importance of insulation, grounding, and procedural discipline.  
- **Future Potential** – Scaling the design with optimized electrodes, magnetic confinement, or grid systems could increase thrust efficiency for practical applications.

# Abstract 
The **Beer Waste Hydrothermal Liquefaction for Biorocket Fuel** project explored how brewery by-products can be converted into energy-dense biocrude suitable for advanced fuel applications. Using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), organic-rich beer waste streams (spent grains, yeast slurry, and trub) were processed under high temperature and pressure to produce a crude-like bio-oil. This bio-oil was then investigated for its suitability as a precursor for biorocket fuels. The project combined bio-resource valorization, thermochemical conversion, and propulsion-focused sustainability research.  

# Project Objectives
This project set out to:
- Apply hydrothermal liquefaction to beer waste streams to generate biocrude.  
- Analyze the yield, composition, and energy density of the resulting bio-oil.  
- Investigate upgrading methods (fractional distillation, catalytic cracking) to produce fuel fractions suitable for rocket propulsion.  
- Evaluate the potential of brewery waste as a feedstock for renewable aerospace fuels.  
- Gain hands-on experience in biofuel process design and thermochemical systems.  

# Design Considerations
Feedstock Selection  
Beer waste was selected due to its high organic content, availability, and potential for valorization in a circular economy framework. Both solid (spent grains) and liquid (slurry, yeast residues) fractions were considered.  

Hydrothermal Liquefaction Process  
Beer waste was processed in a pressurized reactor under subcritical water conditions (typically 250–350 °C and 10–20 MPa). Reaction times, catalyst use, and water-to-biomass ratios were adjusted to maximize oil yield and minimize char formation.  

Fuel Upgrading  
The crude bio-oil produced required upgrading to meet rocket fuel specifications. Distillation was considered for separating light, kerosene-like fractions, while catalytic treatments were investigated for reducing oxygen content and improving stability.  

Rocket Fuel Potential  
Key properties such as energy density, ignition quality, and thermal stability were assessed to evaluate the suitability of the upgraded biocrude fractions for use in liquid-fueled rocket engines.  

# Key Lessons 
- **Feedstock Versatility** – Brewery waste proved to be a promising, abundant, and renewable feedstock for thermochemical conversion.  
- **Process Complexity** – Achieving consistent yields depended heavily on process parameters such as temperature, pressure, and catalysts.  
- **Fuel Quality** – Raw biocrude required significant upgrading before approaching aerospace fuel standards, underscoring the need for multi-step refining.  
- **Sustainable Propulsion** – The project highlighted the potential of linking waste management with advanced propulsion fuels, creating new opportunities for circular bioeconomy aerospace systems.

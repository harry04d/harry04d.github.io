# Abstract 
The **Isolation of Novel Yeast Species from Beer Waste** project investigated the microbial diversity present in residual brewery waste streams, with a focus on yeast. By culturing and isolating strains from waste products such as spent grain liquor and trub, the project aimed to identify unique yeast species with potential applications in fermentation, biotechnology, and bio-material development. This project combined microbiology techniques with sustainability principles, repurposing waste streams as a source of valuable biological discovery.

# Project Objectives
This project set out to:
- Collect and culture yeast populations from beer waste (spent grains, trub, and residual wort).  
- Isolate individual yeast colonies for characterization and comparison.  
- Identify potential new yeast species using morphology and growth behaviour.  
- Explore possible applications of novel yeasts in brewing, bioprocessing, and material production.  
- Gain practical laboratory skills in microbiology, including sterile technique, culturing, and identification.  

# Design Considerations
Sample Collection  
Brewery waste was chosen due to its richness in sugars, proteins, and nutrients that encourage microbial diversity. Samples were collected from fermentation residues and stored under controlled conditions.  

Culturing and Isolation  
Selective media were used to culture yeast colonies while minimizing bacterial growth. Serial dilutions and streak-plate methods were applied to isolate pure strains.  

Characterization  
Yeast isolates were observed for colony morphology, fermentation capacity, and growth under different nutrient conditions. Basic biochemical tests were explored as preliminary tools for identification.  

Potential Applications  
The project considered both traditional uses (brewing and baking) and novel uses such as biofuel production, biodegradable material development, and bioremediation.  

# Key Lessons 
- **Waste as a Resource** – Brewery waste streams provided an abundant and diverse source of microbial life, demonstrating circular economy principles in biotechnology.  
- **Diversity of Yeast** – Isolates displayed a wide range of morphologies and growth behaviours, suggesting significant strain diversity.  
- **Lab Technique** – Maintaining sterile conditions was essential to prevent bacterial contamination and ensure reliable results.  
- **Future Potential** – Initial isolates showed promise for specialized fermentation processes, highlighting the value of continuing exploration into non-conventional yeasts.

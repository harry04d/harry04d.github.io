# Abstract  
The **Bioplastic Development Project** explored the creation of a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based plastics using marine algae species *Ormosira banksii* and *Ulva lactuca*. By processing and blending these algae, a biopolymer-based plastic was formed and then subjected to material testing. The project provided insights into the mechanical and structural properties of algae-based plastics, and their potential as environmentally friendly alternatives.  

# Project Objectives  
From the outset, I set out to:  
- Extract and process biomass from *Ormosira banksii* (a diatom) and *Ulva lactuca* (green sea lettuce).  
- Develop a functional bioplastic sheet through blending and polymerization processes.  
- Conduct mechanical and physical testing to analyze material strength, flexibility, and degradation potential.  
- Compare results against conventional plastics to evaluate the viability of algae-derived alternatives.  

# Design Considerations  

**Material Sourcing and Processing**  
*Ormosira banksii* and *Ulva lactuca* were harvested and dried before being processed into powders. These were combined with natural binders and plasticizers to create a polymer matrix suitable for forming bioplastic films.  

**Fabrication Method**  
The raw algae powders were blended with glycerol and heated to form sheets of bioplastic. Care was taken to control temperature and ratios to balance tensile strength with flexibility.  

**Material Testing and Analysis**  
Samples underwent a range of material tests, including:  
- **Tensile Strength Testing** – to measure resistance under load.  
- **Flexibility and Elasticity** – assessed through bend and stretch tests.  
- **Moisture Absorption** – to evaluate environmental durability.  
- **Biodegradability** – compared against commercial plastics in natural conditions.  

# Key Lessons  

- **Algae as a Renewable Resource** – *Ormosira banksii* and *Ulva lactuca* provided promising feedstocks for sustainable material development.  
- **Processing Challenges** – Balancing strength and flexibility required precise ratios of algae powders to plasticizers.  
- **Material Performance** – The resulting bioplastic demonstrated moderate tensile strength, high biodegradability, but limited water resistance.  
- **Sustainability Potential** – Marine-derived plastics offer an eco-friendly pathway, but improvements in durability are needed before large-scale adoption.

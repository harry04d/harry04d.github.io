# Abstract 
The **High-Vacuum Chamber for Plasma Fusion Testing** project extended earlier vacuum system development to reach ultra-low pressures of 10^-6 millibar. Building on the experience gained with a polycarbonate-based chamber capable of 10^-3 millibar, this phase involved upgrading materials, pumping systems, and sealing strategies to create an environment suitable for small-scale plasma experimentation. The ultimate goal was to provide a stable, high-vacuum platform for preliminary fusion reactor tests, including plasma confinement and discharge experiments.

# Project Objectives
This project set out to:
- Upgrade a vacuum chamber design from 10^-3 to 10^-6 millibar capability.
- Investigate and implement high-vacuum pumping systems, such as turbomolecular or diffusion pumps, in tandem with mechanical forepumps.
- Replace polycarbonate components with materials better suited to ultra-high vacuum, such as stainless steel or borosilicate glass, while retaining optical access for plasma observation.
- Integrate high-voltage feedthroughs, pressure gauges, and plasma ignition electrodes into the chamber design.
- Create a safe and reliable experimental environment for plasma initiation and diagnostics.

# Design Considerations
Vacuum Chamber Materials  
While polycarbonate proved effective for low-vacuum testing, its outgassing limited achievable pressures. For high-vacuum operation, stainless steel and borosilicate glass were selected due to their low permeation, chemical stability, and compatibility with high-vacuum sealing techniques.

Pumping Systems  
Achieving 10^-6 millibar required a two-stage pumping approach: a roughing pump to bring pressure down to ~10^-2 millibar, followed by a turbomolecular or diffusion pump to achieve high-vacuum levels. Backing pressure monitoring and pump protection measures were critical.

Sealing and Flanges  
Metal flanges with Viton O-rings or copper gaskets were incorporated to reduce leaks and outgassing. Surface finishing and bake-out procedures were considered to improve vacuum integrity.

Instrumentation and Plasma Integration  
The chamber was designed with high-voltage feedthroughs for plasma ignition and diagnostic ports for pressure measurement, optical observation, and potential magnetic confinement testing. Optical viewports allowed direct monitoring of plasma behaviour.

# Key Lessons 
- **Material Limitations** – Transitioning from polycarbonate to stainless steel/glass highlighted the importance of minimizing outgassing and structural deformation for high-vacuum operation.
- **Pump Strategy** – Understanding staged pumping and pump compatibility was essential for reliably achieving pressures in the 10^-6 millibar range.
- **Plasma Interaction** – Even basic plasma discharges required careful electrode placement and insulation to avoid arcing and system damage.
- **Safety and Precision** – High-voltage systems combined with high-vacuum environments required strict attention to design safety, grounding, and operational procedures.

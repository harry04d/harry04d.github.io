# Abstract 
The **Agar Gel Electrophoresis of Fungal Species Project** was developed to analyze and compare DNA samples of fungal isolates collected from green camel barramundi tanks. This project aimed to identify genetic similarities and differences between fungal strains to better understand their diversity, potential pathogenicity, and implications for aquaculture health management. By using agar gel electrophoresis as a molecular tool, I gained experience in sample preparation, DNA extraction, gel casting, electrophoresis operation, and band interpretation.

# Project Objectives
From the outset, I set out to:
- Learn the methodology of agar gel electrophoresis for fungal DNA separation and visualization.
- Extract and prepare DNA samples from fungal isolates obtained from aquaculture tanks.  
- Identify potential fungal pathogens by comparing banding patterns with known markers.  
- Develop practical laboratory skills in microbiology and molecular biology techniques.  
- Understand how fungal diversity impacts fish health and aquaculture system sustainability.  

# Design Considerations
Sample Collection and Preparation  
Fungal isolates were obtained from biofilms and tank water in green camel barramundi aquaculture systems. DNA extraction protocols were optimized to ensure high yield and minimal contamination.

Gel Preparation and Electrophoresis Setup  
Standard agarose gels were prepared with ethidium bromide (or alternative safer dyes), and electrophoresis was conducted under controlled voltage and buffer conditions. The process required consideration of gel concentration, run time, and loading accuracy for clear resolution of DNA fragments.  

Data Analysis and Interpretation  
Banding patterns were compared across fungal isolates. The presence, intensity, and position of bands provided insights into genetic diversity and possible pathogenic species within the aquaculture environment.

# Key Lessons
- **Molecular Biology Techniques** – I developed practical skills in DNA extraction, gel preparation, and electrophoresis operation.  
- **Data Interpretation** – Learned to analyze electrophoresis banding patterns as a means of comparing genetic diversity and identifying potential pathogens.  
- **Applied Microbiology in Aquaculture** – Gained understanding of how fungal diversity may influence fish health, biosecurity, and aquaculture sustainability.  
- **Laboratory Precision** – Recognized the importance of accuracy in pipetting, gel loading, and voltage control for reliable results.

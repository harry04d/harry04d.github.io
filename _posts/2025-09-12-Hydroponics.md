# Abstract 
The **PVC Pipe Hydroponic Basil System** was designed to grow fresh basil in a controlled, water-efficient manner on the farm. By circulating nutrient-enriched water through a network of PVC pipes, the system supported healthy basil growth without the need for soil. This project gave me hands-on experience in farm innovation, fluid systems, pump calibration, and sustainable agriculture practices.

# Project Objectives
From the outset, I set out to:
- Build a functioning hydroponic system from cost-effective and widely available materials (PVC pipe, pumps, reservoirs).  
- Learn how nutrient film technique (NFT) and deep-water hydroponics can be adapted for small-scale farm use.  
- Optimize basil growth by controlling nutrient mix, water flow, and light exposure.  
- Explore sustainable methods of farming that use less water and land compared to traditional soil-based farming.  

# Design Considerations
System Structure  
The system was built from 100mm PVC pipes, cut and fitted with net pots for basil plants. Pipes were mounted at a slight incline to allow gravity-fed water return to the nutrient reservoir.  

Pumping and Circulation  
A submersible pump circulated nutrient-rich water from the reservoir through the PVC channels. Flow rate calibration was key to ensuring that basil roots received adequate oxygen and nutrients without waterlogging.  

Nutrient Solution and Growth Control  
Commercial hydroponic nutrients were mixed into the water and monitored for pH and electrical conductivity. Regular adjustments ensured optimal uptake for basil growth. Sunlight exposure was maximized, with consideration for potential shade cloth in high summer.  

# Key Lessons
- **Practical Hydroponics** – Learned how to construct and maintain a hydroponic system using PVC and pumps.  
- **Water and Nutrient Management** – Gained knowledge on monitoring pH, nutrient concentration, and flow rates for crop health.  
- **Sustainability in Agriculture** – Understood the benefits of hydroponics in reducing water use and enabling intensive production on limited land.  
- **System Optimization** – Realized the importance of balancing flow, nutrients, and sunlight for maximizing basil yield.

# Abstract 
The **Heavy-Lift Agricultural Quadcopter** was developed as a prototype UAV to address the challenges of endurance and payload capacity in agricultural spraying. Through this project, I gained practical experience in UAV systems engineering, structural design under heavy loads, and cost-driven innovation. By working on a platform capable of lifting a 40 kg spray payload while running on a tethered ground power supply, I was able to deepen my understanding of the trade-offs between endurance, efficiency, and affordability in UAV design.

# Project Objectives
From the outset, I set out to:
- Learn how to design a UAV capable of lifting and stabilizing heavy payloads (40 kg tank).
- Understand the engineering trade-offs between onboard batteries and tethered power supply for endurance and cost efficiency.
- Gain hands-on experience in integrating autonomous navigation systems (Mission Planner with GPS) into real-world agricultural tasks.
- Apply engineering decision-making to create a UAV that was affordable, maintainable, and farm-ready.


# Design Considerations
Structural Design
I learnt how to analyze and design a UAV frame capable of withstanding the stresses of a large liquid payload. This included considerations of spar thickness, thrust-to-weight ratios, and the importance of distributing loads evenly across the frame to maintain stability.

Power System Design
By comparing onboard batteries with a tethered ground power system, I gained insight into how energy supply directly affects UAV performance, operational costs, and system reliability. I learnt that batteries are the key limiation in flight time and design of quadcopters and agricultural/heavy lifter drones.

Navigation and Control Systems
Learning to configure a flight controller to use remote control, from both a RC controller and Mission software such as Mission Planner with GPS integration. I expanded on this to learn how to feed the flight controller flight paths and spraying operations.

# Key Lessons 

- **Weight to flight-time ratio** - every design choice I made costed me flight time, payload or another factor, thus required me to reconsider my priorities with every decision
- **System Engineering** - I developed a broader understanding of how structural, electrical and software components interact. 
- **Practical Engineering** - By optimizing for affordability and repairability, I adapted my design to real world constraints and attempted to solve real world problems

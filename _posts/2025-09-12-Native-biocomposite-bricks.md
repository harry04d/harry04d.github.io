# Abstract 
The **Native Grass-Reinforced Biocomposite Bricks** project investigated the incorporation of native Australian grass fibres into seaweed–agarose composites to improve their mechanical strength and flexibility. By combining natural polysaccharides from *Hormosira banksii* and *Ulva lactuca* with structural fibres harvested from grasses, the project sought to address limitations in the brittleness and load-bearing capacity of earlier seaweed-derived materials. This work connected materials engineering with ecological design by utilizing both marine and terrestrial biomass resources in developing low-carbon construction alternatives.

# Project Objectives
This project set out to:
- Assess the reinforcing properties of native Australian grass fibres when blended into seaweed–agarose composites.
- Develop prototype bio-bricks with enhanced tensile and compressive strength compared to seaweed-only designs.
- Investigate how fibre orientation, size, and treatment influence flexibility and durability.
- Explore circular material design by integrating locally available plant species into sustainable construction materials.
- Build practical experience in fibre–matrix interaction and natural composite fabrication.

# Design Considerations
Material Selection  
Native Australian grasses were chosen for their availability, toughness, and fibrous cellular structure, which offers natural reinforcement similar to synthetic fibres. When combined with the gel-like matrix of agarose and seaweed polysaccharides, these fibres were hypothesized to provide crack resistance and increased load capacity.

Fibre Processing  
The project considered various preparation methods such as drying, shredding, and pre-treatment of grasses to maximize adhesion with the seaweed–agarose binder. Fibre length and alignment were key variables in achieving both strength and flexibility.

Composite Fabrication  
Design processes focused on balancing fibre volume with matrix consistency to create moldable, uniform mixtures. Bricks were cast in molds and tested under drying and curing conditions to evaluate shrinkage, durability, and structural performance.

# Key Lessons 
- **Fibre Reinforcement** – Natural grass fibres significantly improved crack resistance and load-bearing ability, though optimal ratios required experimentation.
- **Moisture Interaction** – Incorporating fibres influenced water retention and drying time, requiring adjustments in curing methods.
- **Composite Behaviour** – Strength and flexibility were highly dependent on fibre alignment and bonding with the agarose–seaweed matrix.
- **Sustainable Integration** – Using both native plants and marine biomass emphasized the potential for hybrid, locally sourced biocomposites in construction applications.

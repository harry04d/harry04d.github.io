# Abstract  
The **Marine Plant Bacterial Cultivation Project** focused on isolating and cultivating bacterial communities from plant species collected in the ocean environment of Collaroy. By using agar-based cultivation techniques, the project aimed to explore the symbiotic and surface-associated bacteria present on marine plants, providing insights into microbial diversity and potential ecological or biotechnological applications. This project gave me hands-on experience in microbial sampling, sterile techniques, and agar culture analysis.  

# Project Objectives  
From the outset, I set out to:  
- Collect plant samples from an intertidal and nearshore ocean environment in Collaroy.  
- Apply sterile techniques to transfer microbial samples onto agar plates.  
- Observe bacterial growth patterns, colony morphology, and diversity.  
- Gain an understanding of marine microbial-plant interactions and their potential uses.  

# Design Considerations  

**Sample Collection**  
Plant species were collected from rock pools and shallow marine environments at Collaroy. Care was taken to minimize contamination and preserve natural microbial communities during transport to the laboratory.  

**Cultivation Method**  
Nutrient agar and marine-specific agar bases were prepared to support bacterial growth. Samples were swabbed directly from plant surfaces and streaked onto agar plates under sterile conditions. The plates were incubated at controlled temperatures to encourage growth.  

**Observation and Analysis**  
Colony morphology, pigmentation, and growth rates were recorded. Comparisons between nutrient agar and marine agar plates were used to determine the adaptability of different bacterial strains to culture media.  

# Key Lessons  

- **Sterile Technique** – Working in a controlled environment was critical to avoid contamination and ensure accurate results.  
- **Marine Microbial Diversity** – Ocean plant species host a wide range of bacteria, with visible variation in growth patterns and colony types.  
- **Cultivation Challenges** – Not all marine bacteria adapt to artificial agar conditions, highlighting the limitations of lab-based cultivation.  
- **Ecological Insights** – The relationship between marine plants and bacteria could play important roles in nutrient cycling, biofilm formation, and potential biotechnological applications.

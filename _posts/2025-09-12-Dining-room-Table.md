# Abstract  
The **Epoxy Resin Dining Table** was developed as a functional and aesthetic furniture project, combining reclaimed timber bridge beams with modern epoxy resin finishing techniques. The integration of an internal steel frame provided structural stability, ensuring the heavy reclaimed timber could be repurposed into a durable dining surface. This project gave me practical experience in material selection, structural reinforcement, and resin finishing, as well as an appreciation for the balance between functionality, strength, and design.  

# Project Objectives  
From the outset, I set out to:  
- Learn how to design and build a structurally stable dining table from reclaimed timber.  
- Gain experience in working with epoxy resin as both a sealing and aesthetic surface finish.  
- Understand how to integrate steel framing internally to support heavy natural materials.  
- Explore how reclaimed and modern materials can be combined for both sustainability and beauty.  

# Design Considerations  

**Structural Design**  
The reclaimed bridge beams were extremely heavy and uneven in geometry, requiring internal reinforcement to prevent warping or sagging over time. An internal steel frame was designed to distribute loads evenly and ensure the table could withstand daily use. The frame design also allowed for concealed reinforcement, keeping the external look dominated by timber and resin.  

**Material Selection and Resin Application**  
Old bridge beams brought unique character through their weathering, grain patterns, and imperfections. These were carefully prepared and encapsulated in epoxy resin, which served both as a protective surface and as a way to highlight the timber’s history. The resin finish had to be applied in multiple layers, with careful sanding and polishing between coats to achieve a high-gloss, durable surface.  

**Joinery and Assembly**  
The design focused on hidden joints and flush finishes to maintain a clean, modern appearance. The internal steel frame was bolted to the underside of the timber beams, providing rigidity without detracting from the aesthetic.  

# Key Lessons  

- **Structural Reinforcement** – I learned the importance of combining steel framing with timber in furniture design to ensure stability and longevity.  
- **Material Challenges** – Working with reclaimed beams required careful preparation, leveling, and alignment before resin application.  
- **Epoxy Resin Techniques** – I gained practical skills in pouring, curing, sanding, and polishing resin, as well as understanding its limitations with large wooden surfaces.  
- **Design Aesthetics vs Functionality** – Achieving a balance between rustic reclaimed materials and a sleek modern resin finish required constant iteration and testing.

# Abstract 
The **Seaweed-Derived Sustainable Materials** project explored the potential of brown algae (*Hormosira banksii*), green algae (*Ulva lactuca*), and agarose as renewable resources for new material development. The project aimed to investigate their suitability for producing alternative construction products such as bricks and plastic substitutes. Through this work, I engaged in material science experimentation, bio-resource utilization, and sustainability-focused engineering, with the goal of addressing waste, carbon emissions, and resource scarcity in traditional building and plastic manufacturing.

# Project Objectives
This project set out to:
- Explore the mechanical and structural properties of composites made from *Hormosira banksii*, *Ulva lactuca*, and agarose.
- Investigate bio-derived brick production techniques that reduce reliance on cement or clay.
- Assess the feasibility of seaweed–agarose blends as biodegradable alternatives to plastics.
- Develop early prototypes that can be compared against conventional materials in terms of strength, flexibility, and environmental impact.
- Gain hands-on experience in biomaterials engineering, including extraction, processing, and testing methods.

# Design Considerations
Material Selection  
Both *Hormosira banksii* and *Ulva lactuca* were chosen for their abundance, renewable growth cycles, and high polysaccharide content, making them ideal candidates for bio-composite production. Agarose was included as a binding and structural reinforcement agent due to its gelling properties and capacity to stabilize blends.

Processing and Fabrication  
Initial design considerations included drying and powdering seaweed biomass, mixing ratios with agarose, and molding processes for casting into bricks or sheet-like substitutes for plastics. The ability to cure, dry, and maintain structural integrity under environmental conditions was a primary focus.

Sustainability and Circular Design  
By relying on marine biomass, the project emphasizes low-carbon alternatives to conventional materials. A key design principle was that the final product should be biodegradable, affordable, and scalable, with potential applications in both small-scale construction and packaging industries.

# Key Lessons 
- **Material Trade-Offs** – Seaweed-derived composites show promising biodegradability but face challenges in mechanical strength and moisture resistance. Balancing these properties required iterative testing and ratio adjustments.
- **Biomaterials Engineering** – Working with seaweed required new approaches compared to traditional structural materials, including handling organic variability and moisture content.
- **Systems Thinking** – I developed a greater appreciation for how natural resources, industrial processes, and end-of-life considerations all interact in sustainable material design.
- **Prototype Development** – Small-scale tests highlighted both the opportunities and limitations of seaweed-based materials, demonstrating the importance of iterative, experiment-driven design.

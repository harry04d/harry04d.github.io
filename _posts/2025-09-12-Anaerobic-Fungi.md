# Abstract  
The **Gene Sequencing Project** investigated anaerobic fungal species collected from two contrasting environments: the **Snowy Mountains Main Range** and **sub-alluvial ecosystems**. Using a **Nanopore sequencing platform**, DNA was extracted, sequenced, and bioinformatically analyzed to identify fungal species and their ecological roles. This project provided valuable experience in **field sampling, molecular biology, sequencing technologies, and data analysis**, while contributing insights into the biodiversity of anaerobic fungi in alpine and sub-surface habitats.

# Project Objectives  
- Collect anaerobic fungal samples from **alpine** (Snowy Mountains Main Range) and **sub-alluvial** environments.  
- Apply **Nanopore sequencing technology** to identify fungal species.  
- Analyze sequence data to **classify fungi** and assess ecological diversity.  
- Compare results between alpine and sub-alluvial habitats to understand **environmental adaptation**.

# Design Overview  
**Sample Collection**  
- Field sampling conducted in the **Snowy Mountains Main Range** and **sub-alluvial soil deposits**.  
- Anaerobic conditions maintained during collection to preserve microbial communities.  

**DNA Extraction & Sequencing**  
- DNA extracted from fungal cultures.  
- **Nanopore sequencer** used for real-time, long-read DNA sequencing.  
- Generated reads analyzed through bioinformatics pipelines for taxonomic identification.  

**Analysis & Classification**  
- Sequencing revealed multiple fungal species adapted to **low-oxygen** environments.  
- Distinct differences observed between alpine and sub-alluvial samples, reflecting environmental pressures on fungal community composition.

# Key Lessons Learned  
- **Field to Lab Workflow**: Learned how to manage the full cycle of biological research â€” from environmental sampling to genomic sequencing.  
- **Nanopore Technology**: Gained practical experience in handling portable sequencing devices and interpreting long-read data.  
- **Bioinformatics**: Developed skills in processing raw sequencing data, including quality filtering, assembly, and taxonomic classification.  
- **Ecological Insight**: Understood how fungal communities adapt to **different environmental niches**, highlighting biodiversity in underexplored habitats.

# Abstract 
The **Realistic Sand Terrain Wargaming Mat** was created to enhance tabletop wargames with immersive, durable, and visually appealing terrain. By developing a textured surface with sand effects and realistic colouring, the mat provided players with a high-quality product for miniature-based battles. This project focused on blending hobby craftsmanship with product design for the wargaming market.

# Project Objectives
From the outset, I set out to:
- Design and produce a durable game mat with realistic sand terrain suitable for wargaming.  
- Experiment with textures, adhesives, and paints to replicate desert and arid battlefield conditions.  
- Develop a scalable method for producing mats suitable for sale as a tabletop product.  
- Gain insight into hobby product development, from prototyping to finishing techniques.  

# Design Considerations
Surface Material  
A flexible yet sturdy base was chosen to support repeated use and portability. The mat needed to roll or fold without damaging the sand texture.  

Texture Application  
Fine-grain sand and PVA adhesives were applied in layers to replicate realistic terrain while maintaining a playable surface for miniatures. Testing was required to balance texture with ease of dice rolling and miniature stability.  

Colouring and Finishing  
A combination of spray paints, dry brushing, and washes was used to produce natural colour variation, mimicking desert and wasteland environments. Sealants were applied to protect both colour and texture for long-term use.  

Product Scalability  
Consideration was given to how the mat could be reproduced at scale for sales. This included testing drying times, material costs, and packaging for the hobby market.  

# Key Lessons
- **Material Testing** – Learned the importance of choosing adhesives, sands, and paints that balance durability with realism.  
- **Aesthetic Detailing** – Gained experience in painting and finishing techniques to create terrain with depth and variation.  
- **Product Development** – Understood how to adapt hobbyist methods into reproducible products for commercial use.  
- **User Experience** – Recognized the need for mats to be both visually appealing and practical for wargaming playability.

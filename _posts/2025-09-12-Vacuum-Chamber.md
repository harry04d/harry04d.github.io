# Abstract 
The **Vacuum Chamber Development** project focused on building a low-cost, custom vacuum chamber with the target of reaching a pressure of 10^-3 millibar. Beginning with a repurposed steel pot as an initial test chamber, the project later transitioned to a purpose-built system using a 20 mm thick polycarbonate cylinder and matching clear polycarbonate lid. This iterative design process allowed me to gain practical experience in vacuum engineering, material selection, and system sealing techniques while learning the fundamentals of high-vacuum operation.

# Project Objectives
This project set out to:
- Construct an experimental vacuum chamber from scratch, capable of achieving 10^-3 millibar.
- Compare performance between an improvised steel pot chamber and a precision polycarbonate build.
- Learn how to design and implement vacuum seals, flanges, and fittings suitable for low-pressure systems.
- Integrate vacuum gauges and pumps to monitor performance and identify system leaks.
- Gain practical experience in vacuum system engineering, material behaviour under load, and experimental testing.

# Design Considerations
Material Selection  
The first prototype utilized a steel cooking pot as a cost-effective, readily available vacuum vessel. However, this design was limited in visibility and flange integration. A second-generation design used a 20 mm thick polycarbonate cylinder paired with a 20 mm thick clear lid to provide transparency, strength, and easier integration of fittings.

Sealing and Flanges  
Developing airtight seals was critical to achieving low pressures. Gasket materials, O-rings, and machined grooves were tested to optimize flange connections between the chamber body, lid, and pump interface.

Structural Integrity  
At 10^-3 millibar, the chamber must withstand significant external atmospheric pressure. Polycarbonate’s high impact resistance and load-bearing strength were key considerations, while wall thickness ensured safety and minimized deformation under vacuum stress.

Instrumentation and Pumping  
Vacuum pumps were connected via custom-machined ports, with digital and analogue gauges installed for pressure monitoring. Leak testing and progressive pump-down trials were carried out to track performance improvements.

# Key Lessons 
- **Iterative Design** – Starting with a steel pot provided quick insights into sealing challenges before committing to precision machining of polycarbonate.
- **Sealing Complexity** – Even minor leaks prevented reaching low pressures, making seal design and material compatibility crucial.
- **Material Performance** – Polycarbonate offered both strength and transparency, enabling visual inspection during pump-down while maintaining structural integrity.
- **Practical Vacuum Engineering** – Hands-on experience highlighted the importance of surface finish, gasket choice, and pump sizing in achieving and maintaining target pressures.

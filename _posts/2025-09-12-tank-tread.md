# Abstract  
The **Rescue Robot Project** focused on the design and development of a tracked robotic platform capable of maneuvering through **complex and hazardous environments**. Equipped with **tank treads for mobility** and **ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection**, the robot was conceptualized as a search-and-rescue tool to assist in locating and extracting individuals from high-risk scenarios such as collapsed buildings or disaster zones. The project combined elements of **mechanical design, sensor integration, and robotics systems engineering**.

# Project Objectives  
- Develop a **tracked robotic platform** capable of navigating uneven and debris-filled terrain.  
- Integrate **ultrasonic sensors** to detect and avoid obstacles.  
- Demonstrate how robotic systems can be applied to **rescue operations** in dangerous environments.  
- Gain hands-on experience in **multidisciplinary engineering**, including mechanics, electronics, and control systems.

# Design Overview  
**Mobility System**  
- The robot utilized **tank treads**, providing high traction and stability across rough and uneven surfaces.  
- Chosen over wheels for superior performance in cluttered or obstructed environments.  

**Sensing and Navigation**  
- **Ultrasonic sensors** were mounted to provide environmental awareness and obstacle avoidance.  
- Allowed the robot to autonomously adjust its path and prevent collisions in confined or unpredictable spaces.  

**Rescue Application**  
- Designed for use in environments unsafe for humans, such as collapsed structures or hazardous material zones.  
- The system demonstrat

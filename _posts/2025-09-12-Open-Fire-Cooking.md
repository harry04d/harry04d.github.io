# Abstract 
The **Steel Fire Cooking Frame** was developed as a practical and durable solution for roasting goats and cows over an open fire on the farm. Built from welded steel tubing and designed to withstand both heat and heavy loads, the frame allowed for traditional cooking methods at large gatherings, farm events, and celebrations. This project gave me hands-on experience in steel fabrication, structural design, and applying engineering principles to food preparation equipment.

# Project Objectives
From the outset, I set out to:
- Design and build a fire-safe steel frame capable of supporting the weight of whole goats and cows during roasting.  
- Gain practical skills in welding, cutting, and assembling steel structures.  
- Optimize the frame for both durability and ease of use during cooking.  
- Explore traditional cooking methods while adapting them to a modern farm context.  

# Design Considerations
Structural Design  
The frame was constructed from heavy-duty steel tubing to support the weight of large livestock. A rotisserie-style bar was integrated to allow even cooking, with bearings or supports to enable smooth rotation.  

Heat Resistance  
Steel selection and welding techniques accounted for prolonged exposure to open flames and high temperatures, ensuring safety and long-term durability.  

Ease of Assembly and Use  
The frame was designed for portability and disassembly, making it easier to set up and store when not in use. Hooks, clamps, and locking mechanisms were added for secure mounting of livestock.  

Farm Application  
The system was designed to be practical for farm-scale events, allowing for communal cooking in outdoor settings while remaining cost-effective and reliable.  

# Key Lessons
- **Steel Fabrication Skills** – Improved welding, grinding, and cutting techniques while working with heavy-duty steel.  
- **Structural Engineering** – Learned to balance weight distribution, load-bearing strength, and fire resistance in design.  
- **Traditional Cooking Adaptation** – Gained appreciation for traditional livestock roasting methods and how they can be engineered for modern farm use.  
- **Practicality and Safety** – Understood the importance of stability, heat resistance, and user-friendly design when building open-fire cooking systems.

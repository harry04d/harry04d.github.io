# Abstract
The **Autonomous VTOL Crop Duster** is a prototype unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed to enhance agricultural spraying efficiency in orchard environments. Traditional quadcopter drones used for spraying are limited by short flight times, high power demands, and reduced payload capacities. This project explores an alternative configuration — a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) glider — that maximizes endurance, reduces battery consumption, and maintains operational affordability.

# Project Objectives
- Develop a UAV capable of **autonomous flight** for precision spraying in orchards.  
- Achieve **longer endurance** than traditional quadcopters while carrying significant payloads.  
- Demonstrate **cost-effective construction** using 3D printing and lightweight composite fabrics.  
- Design an innovative **launch system** suitable for rural deployment.

The crop duster is based on a **hybrid VTOL glider architecture**. Vertical lift enables take-off and landing in confined orchard spaces, while fixed-wing gliding reduces energy consumption in forward flight.  

**Key Innovations:**
- **Pneumatic Launch System**  
  - Adapted from a nail-gun mechanism to provide reliable, low-cost, compressed-air assisted launches.  
- **Airframe Construction**  
  - Main structure fabricated via **3D printing**.  
  - Covered in **synthetic sailcloth**, ensuring durability while minimizing weight.  
- **Power and Efficiency**  
  - Hybrid VTOL system that transitions to glider flight, reducing motor load and extending endurance.

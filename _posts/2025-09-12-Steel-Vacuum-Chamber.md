# Abstract 
The **Steel Vacuum Chamber for Magnetic Plasma Control** project represented the next stage in developing a high-vacuum environment for small-scale fusion research. Building on earlier work with a polycarbonate vacuum vessel, the design was upgraded to a stainless steel structure to reduce outgassing and safely withstand pressures down to 10^-6 millibar. This chamber was then outfitted with external permanent magnets to begin basic plasma control and confinement testing. The upgrade allowed for safer plasma ignition, more stable vacuum conditions, and exploration of magnetically influenced plasma behaviour.

# Project Objectives
This project set out to:
- Transition from a polycarbonate vacuum chamber to a fully stainless steel design capable of high-vacuum performance.
- Test the compatibility of the steel chamber with turbomolecular pumping systems for pressures in the 10^-6 millibar range.
- Integrate permanent magnets around the chamber to influence plasma flow and evaluate simple magnetic confinement techniques.
- Develop methods to initiate, sustain, and observe plasma discharges within the chamber.
- Gain hands-on experience in combining high-vacuum technology, plasma physics, and magnetic field interactions.

# Design Considerations
Material Upgrade  
Polycarbonate chambers, while useful for early-stage testing, were limited by outgassing and deformation at high vacuum. Stainless steel was selected for its low outgassing, high strength, and compatibility with standard vacuum hardware, enabling reliable sealing with ConFlat flanges and copper gaskets.

Magnetic Control  
A series of neodymium permanent magnets were arranged externally around the chamber walls to create localized magnetic fields. These were used to influence plasma flow, test field alignment, and evaluate confinement efficiency in small-scale plasma discharge experiments.

Plasma Ignition  
The chamber design included high-voltage feedthroughs for plasma generation via electrodes. Optical ports allowed direct observation of plasma behaviour and interactions with applied magnetic fields.

Vacuum Performance  
The steel chamber was connected to a two-stage pumping system, with a roughing pump followed by a turbomolecular pump. Chamber bake-out and leak testing were introduced to reach stable pressures suitable for plasma initiation.

# Key Lessons 
- **Material Advancement** – The shift to stainless steel drastically improved achievable vacuum levels, system reliability, and safety margins.
- **Magnet–Plasma Interaction** – Even basic permanent magnets demonstrated measurable effects on plasma shape and motion, underscoring the complexity of magnetic confinement.
- **Vacuum Engineering** – Achieving and maintaining 10^-6 millibar required careful surface preparation, leak detection, and pump management.
- **Fusion Readiness** – This stage demonstrated the feasibility of combining high-vacuum engineering with plasma control methods, laying the groundwork for more advanced magnetic confinement systems.

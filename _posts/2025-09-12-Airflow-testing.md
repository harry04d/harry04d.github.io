# Abstract 
The **Airflow Testing in a Custom Air Chamber** project focused on building and using a controlled airflow environment to study how different object geometries interact with moving air. The chamber allowed for visualization of airflow patterns and wake formation, providing practical insights into aerodynamics, drag, and flow separation. By experimenting with shapes ranging from simple spheres and cylinders to aerofoil sections, the project served as a hands-on introduction to experimental fluid dynamics and wind tunnel principles.  

# Project Objectives
This project set out to:
- Design and build a small-scale air chamber capable of producing steady, observable airflow.  
- Test airflow interactions with objects of different shapes (spheres, cylinders, plates, aerofoils).  
- Visualize flow patterns using methods such as smoke trails or tufts.  
- Record airflow behaviour to study drag, lift generation, and wake formation.  
- Gain practical experience in experimental aerodynamics and fluid flow analysis.  

# Design Considerations
Air Chamber Design  
The chamber was constructed with a transparent section to allow direct visualization of airflow. A fan unit was used to generate steady flow, with a honeycomb mesh or flow straighteners added to reduce turbulence and improve laminarity.  

Test Objects  
Objects of various shapes and sizes were mounted on thin supports within the chamber. Shapes included spheres, flat plates, streamlined bodies, and aerofoil sections to compare drag and lift characteristics.  

Flow Visualization  
Flow visualization techniques included smoke injection, wool tufts, and lightweight particles to highlight flow separation zones, vortex formation, and wake behaviour behind objects.  

Measurement and Recording  
Observations were recorded via photography and video, enabling frame-by-frame analysis of flow structures. Basic measurements such as pressure drop and airflow velocity were explored using simple instruments.  

# Key Lessons 
- **Flow Visualization** – Smoke and tufts provided clear insights into separation points, vortex shedding, and wake structures.  
- **Shape Effects** – Even small changes in object geometry produced significant differences in drag and turbulence.  
- **Experimental Challenges** – Maintaining steady, laminar flow required careful design of chamber geometry and flow conditioning.  
- **Applied Aerodynamics** – The project highlighted how fundamental aerodynamic principles can be directly observed at small scale, bridging theory and experiment.

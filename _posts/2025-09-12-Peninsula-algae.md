# Abstract  
The **Peninsula Algae Cultivation Project** investigated the use of **Bold’s Basal Medium (BBM)** to grow algae species collected from a peninsula environment. BBM, a nutrient-rich medium originally designed for freshwater algal growth, was adapted for marine-influenced algae samples. This project provided practical experience in algal cultivation, media preparation, and the evaluation of growth dynamics under controlled conditions.  

# Project Objectives  
From the outset, I set out to:  
- Collect algal samples from a peninsula shoreline environment.  
- Prepare and adapt Bold’s Basal Medium for algal cultivation.  
- Observe growth patterns, morphology, and nutrient uptake in a laboratory setting.  
- Evaluate the suitability of BBM for supporting algae from non-freshwater origins.  

# Design Considerations  

**Sample Collection**  
Algae were collected from intertidal pools and rocky outcrops of the peninsula, chosen for their adaptability to fluctuating salinity and nutrient conditions.  

**Media Preparation**  
Bold’s Basal Medium was prepared with its standard mineral nutrient composition (nitrates, phosphates, magnesium, calcium, trace metals). Modifications were tested to account for salinity tolerance, including slight salt supplementation.  

**Growth Observation**  
Algal cultures were maintained under controlled temperature and light regimes to simulate natural conditions. Growth rate was monitored through optical density measurements and visual biomass accumulation.  

# Key Lessons  

- **Media Adaptability** – BBM supported initial algal growth, though salinity adjustments were required for marine-derived species.  
- **Growth Monitoring** – Optical density and visual biomass tracking provided reliable indicators of algal health.  
- **Nutrient Response** – Some peninsula algae adapted well to BBM nutrients, while others required additional supplementation.  
- **Research Potential** – Cultivating algae in controlled media highlighted opportunities for further applications in biofuels, bioplastics, and environmental remediation.

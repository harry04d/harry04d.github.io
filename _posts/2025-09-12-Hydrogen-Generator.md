# Abstract  
The **Hydrogen Generator Project** focused on designing and testing a simple, low-cost electrolysis system to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water. The first prototype used carbon electrodes in a plastic container, producing a mixed gas output. Building on this design, a second iteration introduced a **plastic dome separation system**, which directed hydrogen and oxygen into separate chambers based on cathode and anode placement. This project provided hands-on experience with renewable energy systems, gas separation methods, and practical engineering problem-solving.

# Project Objectives  
- Build a functional **hydrogen generator** using readily available, low-cost materials.  
- Understand the process of **electrolysis** for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.  
- Improve on the first design by **separating hydrogen and oxygen streams** to allow safer collection and storage.  
- Explore potential applications of hydrogen as a **renewable fuel source**.

# Design Overview  
**Prototype 1 — Simple Electrolysis Cell**  
- Plastic container filled with water and electrolyte solution.  
- Carbon electrodes connected to a DC power source.  
- Gas generated at the electrodes but **mixed together**, making collection inefficient and less safe.  

**Prototype 2 — Dome Separation System**  
- Introduced a **plastic dome** to separate hydrogen and oxygen during generation.  
- Cathode and anode placed under separate chambers of the dome.  
- Allowed gases to be collected independently, improving efficiency and safety.

# Key Lessons Learned  
- **Electrode Materials**: Carbon electrodes were effective, affordable, and resistant to corrosion compared to metal alternatives.  
- **Gas Separation**: The dome design significantly improved usability by separating hydrogen and oxygen streams.  
- **System Efficiency**: Voltage and current control directly influenced gas production rates, showing the importance of electrical optimization.  
- **Practical Engineering**: Iterating from a basic design to an improved system demonstrated the value of prototyping and experimentation in solving real-world engineering problems.

# Abstract  
The **Maze-Navigating Robot Project** was developed as part of a course project to explore autonomous navigation and object manipulation in a controlled environment. The robot was equipped with **rubber wheels** for mobility, **ultrasonic sensors** for environmental detection, and a **servo-driven claw** for gripping objects. Its task was to successfully navigate a maze, locate a **tennis ball**, and retrieve it using the claw mechanism. This project demonstrated the integration of **locomotion, sensing, and manipulation systems** into a single robotic platform.

# Project Objectives  
- Design a robot capable of **navigating a maze** autonomously using ultrasonic sensing.  
- Implement **rubber wheel drive** for lightweight and efficient mobility.  
- Develop a **claw manipulator** to grab and carry a tennis ball.  
- Gain practical experience with **robot control systems, sensor integration, and object handling**.

# Design Overview  
**Mobility System**  
- The robot used **rubber wheels** driven by DC motors, providing good maneuverability and speed on smooth surfaces.  
- Differential drive allowed the robot to turn precisely within maze boundaries.  

**Sensing and Navigation**  
- **Ultrasonic sensors** were mounted to detect walls and obstacles within the maze.  
- Sensor data was used to implement a maze-solving algorithm, enabling the robot to adjust its path in real time.  

**Manipulation System**  
- A **servo-powered claw** was attached to the front of the robot.  
- Once the tennis ball was detected, the claw was actuated to securely grip and hold the ball for transport.  

**Task Demonstration**  
- The robot successfully navigated through a test maze and retrieved the tennis ball, proving the viability of combining **maze navigation and object manipulation** in a small-scale robotic platform.

# About Me  

Hi, my name is **Harrison Deacon**, and I am currently studying **Mechanical Engineering** at the **University of New South Wales**. I built this website to showcase my projects, ideas, and passion for engineering across several fields. My main areas of interest are **mechanical systems, chemical engineering, and biotechnology**, and I enjoy working on projects that bring together hands-on design, problem-solving, and innovation.  

Growing up in **Jindabyne**, surrounded by the Snowy Hydro scheme, I was always fascinated by large-scale infrastructure and renewable energy. With my father working as a builder, I also gained practical experience on job sites from a young age — learning to value both **hard work and practical problem-solving**. This background inspired me to pursue engineering, where I could combine creativity with technical skill to design solutions that make a real-world impact.  

At UNSW, I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to projects like **ATOMCraft**, where we are developing a **portable fusion reactor**. My contributions include **designing and constructing the vacuum chamber** and working with the **microwave horn system** to initiate ignition. Projects like these have given me hands-on experience in **mechanical design, fabrication, and system integration**, while also teaching me how to collaborate in multidisciplinary research teams.  

Beyond university, I’ve gained further experience through internships — from helping to design **HVAC and wastewater systems for rocket fuel facilities** at Endeavour Aerospace, to **developing AI tools for weather damage modelling** in the insurance industry. These experiences have broadened my skill set, showing me how engineering connects with energy, sustainability, and emerging technologies.  

In my spare time, I enjoy developing my own projects — from building a **pesticide-spraying drone**, to experimenting with **hydroponic farm systems**, to fabricating **sustainable materials** like native grass bricks. These projects not only challenge my technical skills but also keep me motivated to keep learning and innovating.  

Ultimately, I am especially drawn to **energy systems, aerospace applications, and sustainable technologies**. I thrive on solving problems, getting hands-on with design and fabrication, and working with others to turn ambitious ideas into working prototypes.  

This portfolio represents my ongoing journey as an engineer — combining creativity, technical skills, and curiosity to tackle challenges across mechanical, chemical, and biotech fields.
